          Prep list 101
        </h3>
        <p class="my-3 ">
          The ability to use lists in order to work efficiently is essential in professional cooking. The prep list is one of the first things you see upon arriving and one of the last things before leaving. Amateurs view it as a simple list of things that need to be cooked, or prepared on a given day. This answer is correct, but it's also incomplete. A well made prep list is a guide in structuring your day before you enter service. Preperation is everything. <strong class="section-highlighter"> If you correctly assemble and execute a prep list, everything that comes afterward will be far easier to handle than if preparation details were overlooked.</strong> Good chefs rely on good lists, the same is true for cooks.
        </p>

            Want to know why? It stands as a by the minute reference for oyur time management ability in any given moment. If the list needs to be done by 4pm. You check your watch. it's 3:30, you still have to cut the chives, make risotto, and break down a strip steak. You'll immediately know to start the risotto and that it takes you for example 40 minuttes to cook. You can't butcher the steak while cooking the risotto because the riso needs to be stirred regularly. Chef comes by asking how your looking, and because of your list and ability to use it, you can communicate in detail. Chef I should be fine, but the risotto wont be done until 4:15 or so. Also, I'll be behind cutting the strip steak until then. The chef at this point will be able to make good decisions about how to best proceed given your predicament, because you were able to provide clear information to him/her. Another benefit is ensuring that your station never runs out of anything.

        <p class ="mb-3">
          The end of the night is one of the most is when the magic starts. Most cooks overlook this time. They think that because service is over, it's now time to slow it down, relax, clean up, hang back, and go home. The temptation is easy to fall into. It's been a long day. Your brain is in a fog after the adrenaline from service begins settling. Relaxing comes natural to us after having put in so much effort. If you want to be truly great at cooking, you have to remind yourself that the job is not finihed yet. Don't think one day at a time. Great chefs think about the vision for the restaurant on multiple time scales at once. At the end of the night, when breaking down and cleaning take little notes of anyting you notice that you are low on, menu changes, any prep that will expire soon, any dishes that are starting to sell more, or less. Write these down as you clean. It's important to do this now, because a lot of this information is easily accessible to you via short-term memory. It also allows your mind to piece to begin subconsciously planning your next day. The next day when you see the list already prepared, you will be able to plan your day much more effectively, not to mention that many precious moments have been spared.

          Is based off of good information. 
        </h5>
        <p class = "mb-3">
          One of the most common questions your chef will ever ask you is, "How much X is there in the walk-in?", or, "Do you have enough of Y to get through the weekend?" One of the keys to getting better is being able to communicate effectively and accurately. <strong class ="section-highlighter">Your ability to use a good list is essential in developing your communication ability to it's full potential.</strong> Our minds are great at making plans, but often terrible at remembering any given detail on a whim. Before you begin writing your list, obtain valuable information you will need to write the best plan possible. How many guests are on tomorrow? How many of x,y,z are in the walk-in? What is the prep cook responsible for making on the list? What needs to be communicated with team mates? Have an accurate estimation about how many of each item you are likely to sell tomorrow, and the rest of the week if possible. A good restaurant will already have protocols in place for developing your list. Be sure to adhere to these principles, and make sure you fully understand them. If you are unsure about a piece of information, seek answers. This usually goes a long way in showing initiative, and that your are the type of cook who cares about doing things correctly. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          After writing your list, double check that all of the information is correct. if your are unsure if you have enough tenderloin in the walk-in for tommorrow, go to the walk-in and personally put eyes on it. this also gives you an opportunity to make your bosses job easier. Occasionally, you will be  able to spot snd solve potential problems before they occur. the following day, be prepared to make changes to the list as your information changes. For example, maybe your chef forgot to tell yout that there is a party of 20 that wants tenderloin added to their menu. At this point you will have to potentially prep more, tell chef that your are running low on tenderloin and that he/she may need to order more for the weekend, etc.

        <p class ="mb-3">
          This part is tricky, because its really dependant on how you work as an individual. In my younger days, Emilia, and I worked the saute station. I would work it on the weekends, and during the week she would take over. It's a mistake to think that cooking skills are all that matters. Needless to say, our ability to write prep lists that we could each easily understand would go a long way in determining our success. Early on, we lacked this ability. The lists were either prepared inaccurately, or hard to read because it would simply be one item after another often with little context. Over time, Emilia took the initiative to try and write a better list every night. Around once a week, we would talk about the list directly, get feedback from each other, and make improvements. Over time, the results added more benefits than I could have anticipated. At the top of the list would be the number <strong>911</strong> underlined. Under this line would exist any information that was time sensitive, or very important. Things such as, "Shortrib is coming off the menu today, ask chef what the new entree will be", or "You only have 10 orders of gnocchi for service, chef said to get potatoes in the oven right when you get in, so she can make more at 4!"
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          There would be a sizable margin under this section, followed by a section of items that were marked with a star next to them. We both knew that these were items that needed little time to prepare such as cutting onions, herbs, a vinaigrette, roasting shallots, etc.. 
          After this section, again another marguin would be placed and the work <strong><u>"Backups"</u></strong> in underline would appear. Under this word all of the items that requuired being filled from a backup in the cooler were listed.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          After this was the last section, the word <strong><u>"COOK"</u></strong> everyting under the word were projects that needed to be done before service. this includes anything that takes more than a few minutes to prepare.
        </p>

        <img src="lessons-images/knife.svg" alt="knifey" class = "inline" >
        Sets the tone for the day.
      </h5>

        <p class = "mb-3">
          Coming in after a day off to a list like this was a god send. I would get my station set up, and then read the entire list one full time. then you just address all of the 911s at the top of the list. From there I would start my longest projects, for example get a pot of grits on, and get potatoes on the stove for mashed potatoes, etc. While these projects were working, I would fill all of the items from my backups section, clean my station, and then begin doing the shorter items while keeping an eye on those that are already working. At any point before service I would know if I am behind, or ahead on executing my list. If you're ahead, you can help a teammate, or get more done for the next day. if you realize you are behind, you now have the opprtunity to ask for help before its too late.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Now imagine the scenario if I had to come into a weak prep list that only consisted of a column of items in no  particular order. I would have to discern the meaning of each line, ask questions, personally check a lot of the product, and make a lot of decisions on the fly. This is a recipe for unneccessary mistakes, and sometimes disaster. It also costs highly valuable time.

          the list is a guide, much like a recipe. never look at it as a be all end all answer. There will be times when even a good list falls short, so yopu have to be ready for any scenario.

          The key to buiding a palette long-term is to simply taste everything, every chance 
          you get. After years of tasting chefs build a repetoire of different flavors that
          they can summon at a whim from memory.

          When you taste something the its flavor 
          changes and is ofetn different in the beginning, middle, and end of the bite. When biting into a 
          granny smith apple you are first hit with a punch of acidity, the sweetness slowly comes in. At a point the sweet and sourt notes overlap. Then its subtly more sweet than sour. Once the acidity dies down,
          you can taste subtleties that were hidden in the beginning, some people taste something akin to
          vanilla, others are reminded of sage when the other flavors are faint enough to pick up on the 
          background flavors. Learn to

          <p class="my-3">
            Blindly tasting this with little thought will only leave you with the assurance that for whatever reason, this dish tastes good (If it was prepared properly). This is not how a chef thinks when he or she tastes. If thought is applied questions can be asked... Why does this taste good? Why would it not be as good if I left the balsamic, or basil out of it. How do the flavors compliment each other? Train yourself to answer these questions or seek the help of a chef or cook who might have the answers that you cant seem to find. 
          </p>
          <p class ="mb-3">
            The dish tastes phenominal because fresh tomoatoes are allowed to shine in this application of them. The mozzarella brings both fat and richness which allow the other flavors to be carried around for a longer duration in each bite. The mozzarella(or Burratta) often has a subtle bit of Umami in the background that compliments the subtle umami of a god tomato and brings it out. You bite into a tomato and its acidity cuts straight through the richness of the Mozzarella, and instantly you gain a better subconsious comprehension of the dance between fat and acid. This is far more valuable than reading a cookbook that tells someone that fat and acid contrast one another. The basil offers a subtle freshness which contrasts the other elements. Its sweet aroma lifting up that of the tomato. The sweetness of the balsamic compliments this as well as brings out the sweetness of the tomato. The sweetness of the balsamic if applied in the right quantity is not so much that you can't taste the sweetness of the tomato. On the contrary its sweetness and acidity bring out the best of the tomato, further allowing it to shine. This thought process if applied enough will help you one day know exactly how much vinegar to add do something to contrast it.

            A lot of cooks seem to have trouble with this. Do not be discouraged. These are also important flavors that should also be remembered by the subconsious. It can ofen be hard to determine if it is delicious or not, some protocals can be implimented to ensure that those flavors are still logged and added to the palate. 
            It's a good practice to find someone who likes the thing you are tasting. For example if you naturally dont like mustard, how would you learn what a good dijonaise tastes like. Ask someone you know likes mustard, and/or ask a trusted chef when they aren't too busy. In addition, there are still answerable questions to ask yourself when and after tasting.

            How well is this dish received by others who try it, what do they have to say about it, and how popular is it on the menu? How do the flavors change while tasting? Is every bite the same? Are there any interensting textures, or aromas? How would it taste if I removed element x?

          A mediocre cook who is organized and has strong attention to detail is someone you'll likely never meet, and for good reason. How you prepare yourself for the day ahead goes a long way in ensuring success. There are certain things one can do to become better at preperation on a daily basis. It's a difficult skill to learn, and even harder to master.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          In my younger days as a cook, I thought moving fast was everything. I would scan a recipe, quickly grab  ingredients and start cooking as quickly as possible. This cost me more time than the speed added because I had no system in place to ensure consistency and efficiency. I often found myself looking for my salt, filling an oil bottle, running to the back to grab towels in the middle of prep/service. Running around and grabbing things on the fly got me nowhere fast.

              Everything in its place

          This rule is the cornerstone of the development of a consistent and reliable system. Treat your station like it's your own restaurant. Take ownership of it. Would a great chef run an unorganized kitchen? Then how could a good cook ever have an unorganized work-station. This step is harder than it sounds because every work station is different.

                This step alone will save you so much time during service. A wasted movement may only cost you a few seconds, but over the course of a service, they add up quickly. Any time you catch yourself reaching far away to grab something that you use all of the time, It should be put in a more accessible location. For example. if you are working a grill station your tongs should be close to the grill as well as whatever proteins you are cooking. The proteins that you sell the most of should be the easiest to access(while still making sure to follow serve-safe rules of course.) This rule can be applied to any station you work. A salad, or Garde Manger station ideally would have all of its salad dressings in a specified area, usually a third pan. The dressing that sells the most should be in the front, followed by the second most, etc.

                This part of the system is pretty self-explanitory. It's reason is two-fold: It prevents your station from being cluttered, while also helping your muscle memory. Adhering to this structure will ensure you are never wasting mental energy looking for things. Most movements will require little thought after this step is implimented into your subconscious mind. During prep, if a project only needs you to use a whisk once, remove the whisk from your station the second you are done with it. Are you done cutting you chives? Put the rest uf the unused chives back in the walk-in, etc.

              Develop your system with the goal of being organized, efficient, and clean. If any part of your set up, or system does not meet these three categories, it might be time to consider a different solution.

          Here is an example routine.. I first arrive at work 5 minutes early. i wash my hands thoroughly. Then I begin folding my towels for the evenings service. Once my towels are folded, I like to get a confirmation on how many guests have reservations this evening. After that I whipe my station clean of any left over mess from the AM cooks, down to the tiniest smudge. From there I grab a sanitizer bucket, fill it and put it in its designated place on my station. All of these things can be done on almost any station, at almost any restaurant.

          From there I like to examine every food item that is already stocked on my station. I taste, smell, check dates etc. Often times at this point there is something i want to communicate to a chef or Sous, such as maybe the pickled onions taste more acidic than usual, or I'm unsure if there are enough ribeye portions... If the chef is busy, I'll mark it on my clipboard/notebook to mention it to him/her when they are available. This gives me another opportunity to understand how my chef thinks and makes decisions.

          I have a knack for missing things on my station if i gather them at the last minute, so at this point I usually grab everything needed to set up my station, and put all of those things in their place. Examples of this are things like tongs, rubber spatulas, a wooden spoon if I have risotto on the menu, squeeze bottles, steamwell items, ladles, tasting spoons. I also make special note to grab anythings i can remember haven forgotten previously.
