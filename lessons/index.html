          Taste Everything

        <p class="my-3">
          The key to buiding a palette long-term is to simply taste everything, every chance 
          you get. After years of tasting chefs build a repetoire of different flavors that
          they can summon at a whim from memory.

        <p class="mt-2">
          When you taste something the its flavor 
          changes and is ofetn different in the beginning, middle, and end of the bite. When biting into a 
          granny smith apple you are first hit with a punch of acidity, the sweetness slowly comes in. At a point the sweet and sourt notes overlap. Then its subtly more sweet than sour. Once the acidity dies down,
          you can taste subtleties that were hidden in the beginning, some people taste something akin to
          vanilla, others are reminded of sage when the other flavors are faint enough to pick up on the 
          background flavors. Learn to <b class = "section-highlighter">be fully present when tasting</b>. It's like a muscle that grows stronger
          with practice.

            A few seconds after tasting, I find it helpful to think on what I experienced. This will aid in reinforcing the memory of what you just tasted. Let's break down a classic dish! Caprese usaually consisists of

          <p class="my-3">
            Blindly tasting this with little thought will only leave you with the assurance that for whatever reason, this dish tastes good (If it was prepared properly). This is not how a chef thinks when he or she tastes. If thought is applied questions can be asked... Why does this taste good? Why would it not be as good if I left the balsamic, or basil out of it. How do the flavors compliment each other? Train yourself to answer these questions or seek the help of a chef or cook who might have the answers that you cant seem to find. 
          </p>
          <p class ="mb-3">
            The dish tastes phenominal because fresh tomoatoes are allowed to shine in this application of them. The mozzarella brings both fat and richness which allow the other flavors to be carried around for a longer duration in each bite. The mozzarella(or Burratta) often has a subtle bit of Umami in the background that compliments the subtle umami of a god tomato and brings it out. You bite into a tomato and its acidity cuts straight through the richness of the Mozzarella, and instantly you gain a better subconsious comprehension of the dance between fat and acid. This is far more valuable than reading a cookbook that tells someone that fat and acid contrast one another. The basil offers a subtle freshness which contrasts the other elements. Its sweet aroma lifting up that of the tomato. The sweetness of the balsamic compliments this as well as brings out the sweetness of the tomato. The sweetness of the balsamic if applied in the right quantity is not so much that you can't taste the sweetness of the tomato. On the contrary its sweetness and acidity bring out the best of the tomato, further allowing it to shine. This thought process if applied enough will help you one day know exactly how much vinegar to add do something to contrast it.

            A lot of cooks seem to have trouble with this. Do not be discouraged. These are also important flavors that should also be remembered by the subconsious. It can ofen be hard to determine if it is delicious or not, some protocals can be implimented to ensure that those flavors are still logged and added to the palate. 
            It's a good practice to find someone who likes the thing you are tasting. For example if you naturally dont like mustard, how would you learn what a good dijonaise tastes like. Ask someone you know likes mustard, and/or ask a trusted chef when they aren't too busy. In addition, there are still answerable questions to ask yourself when and after tasting.

            How salty was it? Which part of the dish was the star, and what was done to highlight it?
            How well is this dish received by others who try it, what do they have to say about it, and how popular is it on the menu? How do the flavors change while tasting? Is every bite the same? Are there any interensting textures, or aromas? How would it taste if I removed element x?

        <p>
          Knowing how to ask questions and respond to them is a major piece of learning to think like a chef. The more this skill improves, the bigger the effect on your overall skill-set...

          A mediocre cook who is organized and has strong attention to detail is someone you'll likely never meet, and for good reason. How you prepare yourself for the day ahead goes a long way in ensuring success. There are certain things one can do to become better at preperation on a daily basis. It's a difficult skill to learn, and even harder to master.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
          In my younger days as a cook, I thought moving fast was everything. I would scan a recipe, quickly grab  ingredients and start cooking as quickly as possible. This cost me more time than the speed added because I had no system in place to ensure consistency and efficiency. I often found myself looking for my salt, filling an oil bottle, running to the back to grab towels in the middle of prep/service. Running around and grabbing things on the fly got me nowhere fast. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          A common synonym for mise en place is 
            <str class="section-highlighter">
              Everything in its place
            </str> 
          This rule is the cornerstone of the development of a consistent and reliable system. Treat your station like it's your own restaurant. Take ownership of it. Would a great chef run an unorganized kitchen? Then how could a good cook ever have an unorganized work-station. This step is harder than it sounds because every work station is different.

              <p class="mb-3"> 
                This step alone will save you so much time during service. A wasted movement may only cost you a few seconds, but over the course of a service, they add up quickly. Any time you catch yourself reaching far away to grab something that you use all of the time, It should be put in a more accessible location. For example. if you are working a grill station your tongs should be close to the grill as well as whatever proteins you are cooking. The proteins that you sell the most of should be the easiest to access(while still making sure to follow serve-safe rules of course.) This rule can be applied to any station you work. A salad, or Garde Manger station ideally would have all of its salad dressings in a specified area, usually a third pan. The dressing that sells the most should be in the front, followed by the second most, etc.

                 Put everything back in its place immediately. 
              </h5>
              <p>
                This part of the system is pretty self-explanitory. It's reason is two-fold: It prevents your station from being cluttered, while also helping your muscle memory. Adhering to this structure will ensure you are never wasting mental energy looking for things. Most movements will require little thought after this step is implimented into your subconscious mind. During prep, if a project only needs you to use a whisk once, remove the whisk from your station the second you are done with it. Are you done cutting you chives? Put the rest uf the unused chives back in the walk-in, etc.

          Here is an example routine.. I first arrive at work 5 minutes early. i wash my hands thoroughly. Then I begin folding my towels for the evenings service. Once my towels are folded, I like to get a confirmation on how many guests have reservations this evening. After that I whipe my station clean of any left over mess from the AM cooks, down to the tiniest smudge. From there I grab a sanitizer bucket, fill it and put it in its designated place on my station. All of these things can be done on almost any station, at almost any restaurant. 
        </p>
        <p>
          From there I like to examine every food item that is already stocked on my station. I taste, smell, check dates etc. Often times at this point there is something i want to communicate to a chef or Sous, such as maybe the pickled onions taste more acidic than usual, or I'm unsure if there are enough ribeye portions... If the chef is busy, I'll mark it on my clipboard/notebook to mention it to him/her when they are available. This gives me another opportunity to understand how my chef thinks and makes decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a knack for missing things on my station if i gather them at the last minute, so at this point I usually grab everything needed to set up my station, and put all of those things in their place. Examples of this are things like tongs, rubber spatulas, a wooden spoon if I have risotto on the menu, squeeze bottles, steamwell items, ladles, tasting spoons. I also make special note to grab anythings i can remember haven forgotten previously.
